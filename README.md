# Authorship-identification
Authorship identification
Definition of the task:
Create a corpus by retrieving some texts from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/) as follows: Download the written works of Banjo Paterson, Charles Dickens, and at least two more authors of your choice (exclusions apply, see footnote1).
Suitably split the corpus into a training and test set.
Deploy a suitable machine learning method to create a model of the training set. The aim is to have a model that is capable of mapping a given text to its author.
Apply the model to the test set by presenting the texts in the test set to the model then verify whether the predicted authorship is correct. You aim should be at creating a model that maximizes the accuracy of the prediction.
